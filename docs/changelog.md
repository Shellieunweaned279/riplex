The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/).

## 2026-05-03

### Changed

- Installation guide: macOS pre-built executables now ship as separate `arm64` (Apple Silicon) and `x86_64` (Intel) builds; added instructions to pick the right one and remove the Gatekeeper quarantine flag.
- Installation guide: "Installing from source" section now includes venv setup steps and a macOS SSL fix for Homebrew Python users (`SSL_CERT_FILE` via certifi).
- Installation guide: added macOS tkinter section for folder picker support.

### Added

- New troubleshooting guide (`docs/troubleshooting.md`) covering: makemkvcon not on PATH (Flatpak issue), drive not detected, invalid config file, TMDb API key signup, and dvdcompare lookup failures
- `find_ffprobe()` helper: all ffprobe consumers now check `~/.riplex/bin/`, `/usr/local/bin/`, and `/opt/homebrew/bin/` in addition to PATH.
- macOS auto-download: "Install Missing Tools" on macOS < 14 auto-downloads ffprobe from evermeet.cx to `~/.riplex/bin/`; opens download pages for MakeMKV and MKVToolNix.
- macOS .app bundle detection: `find_makemkvcon()` checks `/Applications/MakeMKV.app/`; `find_mkvmerge()` and `find_mkvpropedit()` check `/Applications/MKVToolNix.app/`.
- Dual-arch macOS CI builds (`macos-13`/x86_64 and `macos-14`/arm64) in release workflow.
- Arch-aware macOS update checker in GUI updater.
- Install progress bar and streaming output for Homebrew installs on macOS 14+.
- Graceful tkinter fallback in folder picker and welcome screen browse buttons.
- Linux apt support in GUI tool installer.
